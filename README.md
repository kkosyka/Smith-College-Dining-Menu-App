Story:</br>
I wanted to give myself a personal project since I was on campus during fall break '17. I felt like I have not been able to code a lot during the school year since my classes are mainly theory, so I decided to create someting I have never made. Thus, I decided to create this menu app as I wanted to create my first mobile application, and plus, that it could help out others (fellow Smithies :) ). I will admit, I am pretty proud of creating something useful, and with the help of many resources like StackOverflow!
