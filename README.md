Story/Thoughts:</br>
I wanted to give myself a personal project since I was on campus during fall break '17. I felt like I have not been able to code a lot during the school year since my classes are mainly theory, so I decided to create someting I have never made. This break, I was really interested in learning UX/mobile application. Thus, I decided to create this menu app that was sleek and minimal as I wanted to create my first mobile application, and plus, that it could help out others (fellow Smithies :) ). I will admit, I am pretty proud of creating something useful and functioning, self-taught with the help of Google & StackOverflow!! Maybe I'll make more apps, it was pretty fun :P </br>
Definitley a huge learning exerience!!!
